          Hi, I&lsquo;m Kim. Nice to meet you!
          <br />
          Highly motivated Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Engineer with an MSc in Artificial Intelligence for the Creative Industries (Distinction) from the University of York, where I earned The School Award for achieving the highest grade point average across the course. I specialize in blending technical AI and ML expertise 
          with creative problem-solving. 
          <br /> My unique skillset, combining coding, data handling, and AI proficiency with a background in marketing, SEO, and social media, gives me a unique insight and I am passionate about using this experience to develop strong AI-driven solutions that solve tangible, real-world, problems.
